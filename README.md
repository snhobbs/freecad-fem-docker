# freecad-fem-docker
A Docker image that installs FreeCAD, Elmer, and Z88 for use with the FEM workbench.
It does not install [MYSTRAN](https://github.com/MYSTRANsolver/MYSTRAN/releases/tag/16.0.0) since they stopped releasing Linux builds. It can be built from source and added.

Elmer currently only has PPAs for up to Ubuntu 22.04 so this is the version used.
